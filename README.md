# 💻 NexusPay Frontend — Secure International Payment Platform

### 📘 About This Project

NexusPay Frontend is a **React + TypeScript web application** that connects to the secure NexusPay API to simulate international payment processing. It demonstrates strong **security**, **usability**, and **Task 2 compliance** by providing a realistic front-end banking experience.

It uses **Material UI**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Vite** for a clean, fast, and modern interface.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This web app simulates how customers and staff members would interact with a secure payment system. The goal is to demonstrate:

* Proper frontend authentication (JWT, session persistence)
* Multi-step payment creation and verification
* Clear role separation (customer vs staff)
* A polished, user-friendly interface for marking and testing

## 🧭 Navigation Overview

| Section          | Role     | Description                   |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/login`         | Customer | Login with credentials        |
| `/register`      | Customer | Register new user             |
| `/staff-login`   | Staff    | Staff login (no OTP)          |
| `/dashboard`     | All      | Role-based dashboards         |
| `/payments`      | Customer | Payment history               |
| `/payments/new`  | Customer | New payment wizard            |
| `/staff`         | Staff    | Pending/verified/SWIFT queues |
| `/beneficiaries` | Customer | Manage saved recipients       |
| `/profile`       | All      | Update personal info          |

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified Logic)

### 1️⃣ Authentication Flow

* Login → JWT created → Stored in localStorage.
* On refresh → `AuthProvider` validates token via `/auth/me`.
* Expired tokens → auto logout + redirect to login.

### 2️⃣ Payment Flow

```
Draft → Pending → Verified → Submitted to SWIFT → Completed
```

Customers see progress visually; staff control verification.

### 3️⃣ PDF Generation

* jsPDF renders receipts with NexusPay branding.
* Automatically includes timestamps and transaction IDs.

## 🎨 Design Principles

* **Material Design 3 (MUI)** — clean, professional interface.
* **Responsive Layout** — adapts for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* **Light/Dark Mode** — theme stored in localStorage.
* **Accessible Typography** — Inter font for clear readability.
* **Visual Feedback** — Toasts, modals, and loading states for every action.
